Feature: Locked segments

  Background:
    Given I am user "U"
    And I have toggles:
      | Toggle name         | Is released | Is visible | User toggle |
      | Inaccessible toggle | No          | No         | No          |
      | Accessible toggle   | No          | Yes        | No          |
      | Released toggle     | Yes         | Yes        | No          |
      | User toggle         | No          | Yes        | Yes         |


  Scenario: User is in segment for toggle, but toggle is not visible
    Given user "U" is in locked segment "Segment of users"
    And there is an active toggle policy "Inaccessible toggle" linked to "Segment of users"
    Then toggle "Inaccessible toggle" is not active

  Scenario: User is in segment for toggle, but toggle is visible

  Scenario: User is in locked segment for toggle, with disabled policy, but toggle is released
    Given user "U" is in locked segment "Segment of users"
    And there is a inactive toggle policy "Released toggle" linked to "Segment of users"
    Then toggle "Released toggle" is active

  Scenario: User is in locked segment for toggle, with disabled policy, but toggle is released
    Given user "U" is in locked segment "Segment of users"
